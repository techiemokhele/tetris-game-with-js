# tetris-game-with-js
Tetris is a surprising game. The aim of Tetris is simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. You can move the blocks around, either left to right, and/or you can rotate them. Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, youâ€™ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.
